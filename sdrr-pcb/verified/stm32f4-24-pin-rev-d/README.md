# STM32F4 24 Pin Rev D

23xx (STM32F4 24 pin) ROM replacement SDRR PCB.

This revision has been verified to support

- the STM32F401 and STM32F411 variants
- acting as 2364 and 2332 ROM replacements in the Commodore PET, VIC-20 and C64 (50Hz/PAL).

Note that the gerbers are currently untested - the design has been verified via [OSH Park](#ordering-bare-pcbs).

## Ordering Bare PCBs

[![Order from OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/assets/badge-5b7ec47045b78aef6eb9d83b3bac6b1920de805e9a0c227658eac6e19a045b9c.png)](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/E7lLKM9E)

Alternatively, you can order from your preferred PCB manufacturer using the Gerber files provided in the [`gerbers/`](gerbers/) directory.

## Errata

All corrections have been reflected in the BOM below, but not the schematic or gerbers.

- **C9** should be 4.7uF, or the STM32F411 will lock up at 100MHz.
- **U3** recommend using AP2112K-3.3 in place of the RT9013, to reduce switching noise, which can cause failure to boot on some systems.
- **R4, R5, R6** do not need to be populated - the firmware uses internal pull-downs.

## Notes

- **Does not** support the STM32F405 or STM32F415 variants.
- There is no status LED on this revision, although there is a power LED.
- There are only 3 image select jumpers on this revision, so only up to 8 images can be selected.
- Most passives are 0402.

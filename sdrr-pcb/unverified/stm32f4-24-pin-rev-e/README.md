# STM32F4 24 Pin Rev E

**Unverified** - this revision has not yet been tested or confirmed to work.  Order PCBs at your own risk.

23xx (STM32F4 24 pin) ROM replacement SDRR PCB.

This revision has two key improvements over rev D:

- STM32F405 and STM32F415 variants are now supported - note there are some BOM differences between the F401/F411 and F405/F415 variants.
- No 0402 passives are used - all passives are 0603, which is easier to hand solder.  The PCB footprint remains the same.

## Ordering Bare PCBs

[![Order from OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/assets/badge-5b7ec47045b78aef6eb9d83b3bac6b1920de805e9a0c227658eac6e19a045b9c.png)](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/9TJoAirm)

## Errata

All corrections have been reflected in the BOM below, but not the schematic or gerbers.

- **U3** recommend using AP2112K-3.3 in place of the RT9013, to reduce switching noise, which can cause failure to boot on some systems.

## Notes

- Now supports STM32F405 and STM32F415 variants, in addition to the STM32F401 and STM32F411 variants.

## Changelog

- Consolidated and improved 401/411 vs 405/415 support - all variants are supported on the same board with minimal component changes required between variants.
- All passives are 0603.
- Renumbered components.
- Corrected VCAP_1 value for F401/F411 to 4.7uF (2.2uF causes F411 to lock up at 100MHz).
- Removed pull-downs on image select pins, to reduce component count (device uses internal pull-downs).
- Power LED replaced with status LED driven by PB15.
- Added 4th image select jumper (PB7), allowing up to 16 images to be selected.
- Limited silk-screen markings are provided.

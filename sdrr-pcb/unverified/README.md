# Unverified PCB Revisions

This folder contains design and manufacturing files for unverified revisions of the SDRR PCB. These revisions have not been tested or confirmed to work with specific STM32 microcontroller variants, and may not be fully supported by the stock SDRR firmware.

Revisions:

- [28 pin Rev A](./stm32f4-28-pin-rev-a/README.md) - 28-pin ROM replacement for 23128 and possibly 23256/23512 ROMs.

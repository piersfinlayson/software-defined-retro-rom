# One ROM

**One ROM To Rule Them All**

The most flexible ROM replacement for your retro computer. It is highly configurable and low-cost.  Get them fabbed at JLC for under $5 each in a quantity of 10 or more.

One ROM emulates any system's 2364, 2332 and 2316 ROMs, with any chip select configuration, and can serve different images to multiple ROM sockets simultaneously.

Replaces failed ROMs in Commodore 64s, VIC-20s, PETs, disk drives.

One ROM was formerly known as Software Defined Retro ROM (SDRR).

## Key Features

üí∞ Based on **[$2 microcontroller](docs/STM32-SELECTION.md)**.

‚ö° **[Fast](docs/STM32-SELECTION.md)** enough for PETs, VIC-20s, C64s, 1541s, IEEE drives, etc. Support faster systems with higher end microcontroller.

üìê **[Same footprint](docs/images/sdrr-24-pin-side.png)** as original ROMs - doesn't overhang the socket like other solutions.

üöÄ **[Quick programming](docs/PROGRAMMING.md)** - just connect 4 wires and `make run`. No programming jigs necessary.

üîå **[Use a $5 programmer](docs/PI-PICO-PROGRAMMER.md)** - no expensive EEPROM programmer required.

üõ†Ô∏è **[Reflash in situ](docs/PROGRAMMING.md)** - no need to remove the ROM from the host when reprogramming.

‚öôÔ∏è **[Software configurable](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)** chip select lines - no hardware jumpers required.

üíæ Stores up to **[16 ROM images](docs/STM32-SELECTION.md)** of different sizes and chip select configurations.  Image selectable via jumpers.

üì¶ **[Replace multiple ROMs with one ROM](docs/MULTI-ROM-SETS.md)** a single One ROM can replace up to 3 original ROMs e.g. all of C64 kernel, BASIC, character set.

üîÄ **[Dynamic bank switching](docs/MULTI-ROM-SETS.md)** - switch between ROM images on the fly, e.g. different char ROMs.

üíª **[Hackable at runtime](docs/RUNTIME-ACCESS.md)** - change the ROM images being served and access telemetry from the ROM at runtime using **[Airfrog](https://piers.rocks/u/airfrog)** or other SWD probes.

üß© **[Images combined automatically](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)** - no need to manually build up your own larger PROM image containing multiple retro ROMs.

üè≠ **[Two layer PCB](sdrr-pcb/README.md)**, component on single-side, limited BOM for low manufacturing cost/complexity.

üéØ Supports multiple **[STM32F4xxR](docs/STM32-SELECTION.md)** variants: F401, F411, F405, F446 (others can be added).

üîì **[Open source](LICENSE.md)** software and hardware.

## Introduction

The video below provides an introduction to the Software Defined Retro ROM:

## Hardware

This is the STM32F4 24-pin version, hardware revison F.  See [sdrr-pcb](sdrr-pcb/README.md) for the hardware designs and documentation.

## Quick Start

You have two options

- [use the pre-built binaries](#pre-built-binaries)
- [build the firmware yourself.](#build-yourself)

### Pre-built Binaries

Use your favourite STM32 programmer to flash the pre-built binaries from the project's [releases](https://github.com/piersfinlayson/software-defined-retro-rom/releases/) page.  Scroll down to the "Assets" section of the latest release, and download the `bin-*.zip` or `elf-*.zip` file for your STM32 variant.  These zip files contain pre-built binaries for the various One ROM image collections, including the C64, VIC-20, PET, and 1541 disk drive.

### Build Yourself

Once you have the project cloned, and the required [dependencies](INSTALL.md) installed, you can build and flash an One ROM image using the following commands - replace `f411re` with your [target STM32 variant](#supported-stm32-microcontrollers), and [`config/c64.mk`](/config/c64.mk) with the [configuration](config/README.md#available-configurations) you want to use.

```bash
# C64
STM=f411re CONFIG=config/c64.mk make run
```

```bash
# VIC-20 (PAL)
STM=f411re CONFIG=config/vic20-pal.mk make run
```

```bash
# PET 40 column 50Hz
STM=f411re CONFIG=config/pet-4-40-50.mk make run
```

This will download the desired ROM images automatically, generate the required firmware, and flash it to One ROM.

### After Flashing

Set the [One ROM jumpers](docs/IMAGE-SELECTION.md) to select the desired ROM image (see the [config file](/config/), or logs from your One ROM device, for which # corresponds to which image) and you're now ready to install the One ROM device in your retro system.

For configuration options, see [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) and the [Makefile](Makefile).

## Debugging

The best place to start with debugging is [`Logging`](docs/LOGGING.md).  This will help you see what the One ROM is doing, and why it may not be working as expected.

If you have an [Airfrog](https://piers.rocks/u/airfrog), you can use it to inspect the One ROM firmware and its current state.

If you'd like a hand, raise an issue on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/piersfinlayson/software-defined-retro-rom/issues).  Please provide:

- your build configuration
- the output from `make info-detail`
- any logging from One ROM
- the STM32 variant you are using and the PCB type/revision
- the retro system you are trying to One ROM with.

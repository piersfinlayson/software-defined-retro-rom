# Software Defined Retro ROM (SDRR)

A highly configurable and low-cost ROM replacement solution for vintage computers.  Replace failed ROMs in Commodore 64s, VIC-20s, PETs, and other retro systems with a $2 microcontroller.

Emulates 2364, 2332 and 2316 ROMs using the STM32F4 family of microcontrollers.  Replaces kernel, BASIC, character set, diagnostic, and application ROMs.

## Key Features

- üí∞ Based on **sub $2 microcontroller**.
- ‚ö° **Fast** enough for PETs, VIC-20s, C64s, 1541s, IEEE drives, etc. Support faster systems with STM32F405R.
- üìê **Same footprint** as original ROMs - doesn't overhang the socket like other solutions.
- üöÄ **Quick programming** - just connect 4 wires and `make run`. No programming jigs necessary.
- üîå **Use a $5 programmer** - no expensive EEPROM programmer required.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Reflash in situ** - no need to remove the ROM from the host when reprogramming.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Software configurable** chip select lines - no hardware jumpers required.
- üíæ Stores up to **16 ROM images** of different sizes and chip select configurations.  Image selectable via jumpers.
- üß© **Images combined automatically** - no need to manually build up your own larger PROM image containing multiple retro ROMs.
- üè≠ **Two layer PCB**, component on single-side, limited BOM for low manufacturing cost/complexity.
- üéØ Supports multiple **STM32F4xxR** variants: F401, F411, F405, F446 (others can be added).
- üîì **Open source** software and hardware - see [License](LICENSE.md)

## Hardware

This is the STM32F4 24-pin version, hardware revison F.  See [sdrr-pcb](sdrr-pcb/README.md) for the hardware designs and documentation.

## Quick Start

You have two options

- [use the pre-built binaries](#pre-built-binaries)
- [build the firmware yourself.](#build-yourself)

### Pre-built Binaries

Use your favourite STM32 programmer to flash the pre-built binaries from the project's [releases](https://github.com/piersfinlayson/software-defined-retro-rom/releases/) page.  Scroll down to the "Assets" section of the latest release, and download the `bin-*.zip` or `elf-*.zip` file for your STM32 variant.  These zip files contain pre-built binaries for the various SDRR image collections, including the C64, VIC-20, PET, and 1541 disk drive.

### Build Yourself

Once you have the project cloned, and the required [dependencies](INSTALL.md) installed, you can build and flash an SDRR image using the following commands - replace `f411re` with your [target STM32 variant](#supported-stm32-microcontrollers), and [`config/c64.mk`](/config/c64.mk) with the [configuration](config/README.md#available-configurations) you want to use.

```bash
# C64
STM=f411re CONFIG=config/c64.mk make run
```

```bash
# VIC-20 (PAL)
STM=f411re CONFIG=config/vic20-pal.mk make run
```

```bash
# PET 40 column 50Hz
STM=f411re CONFIG=config/pet-4-40-50.mk make run
```

This will download the desired ROM images automatically, generate the required firmware, and flash it to the SDRR device.

### After Flashing

Set the [SDRR jumpers](docs/IMAGE-SELECTION.md) to select the desired ROM image (see the [config file](/config/), or logs from your SDRR device, for which # corresponds to which image) and you're now ready to install the SDRR device in your retro system.

For configuration options, see [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) and the [Makefile](Makefile).

## Supported STM32 Microcontrollers

Most STM32F4xxR (LQFP-64) variants will work, but the following are supported out of the box by the build system:

| Model | Max ROM Images | Build variant |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| STM32F401RBT6 | 6 | f401rb |
| STM32F401RCT6 | 14 | f401rc |
| STM32F401RET6 | 16 | f401re |
| STM32F411RCT6 | 14 | f411rc |
| STM32F411RET6 | 16 | f411re |
| STM32F405RGT6 | 16 | f405rg |
| STM32F446RCT6 | 16 | f446rc |
| STM32F446RETx | 16 | f446re |

The highest performance supported variant is the STM32F446RET6, primarily because it has the fastest max clock speed (180MHz vs 168MHz for the F405, 100MHz for the F411 and 84MHz for the F401).  This means it will support the widest range of retro systems.  However, it costs more, and will draw more power and generate more heat.

The largest flash capacity is the STM32F405RGT6, but this extra space if currently unused, and the F405 is also only supported from PCB rev E onwards.

For more details about selecting the appropriate STM32 variant for your application, see [docs/STM32-SELECTION.md](docs/STM32-SELECTION.md).

If you'd like another variant supported, raise an issue via github.

## Debugging

The best place to start with debugging is [`Logging`](docs/LOGGING.md).  This will help you see what the SDRR is doing, and why it may not be working as expected.

// This file contains the STM32F4 Cortex-M4 hand-crafted assembly that
// implements the main serving bytes loop that emulates the ROM(s).
//
// It is highly optimised for speed and aims to exceed (i.e. beat) the 300ns
// access time of the fastest 2332/2364 ROMs.  (Slower ROMs supported 350ns and
// 450ns access times.)
//
// HW_REV_D with the STM32F411 at 100MHz is fast enough to replace C64 kernal
// basic, and character ROMs.  The character ROM is a 350ns ROM.
//
// This implementation achieves its aims by
// - running the STM32F4 at its fastest possible clock speed from the PLL
// - implementing the main loop in assembly (this module)
// - assigning data/CS pins to the same port, starting at pin 0, and data pins
//   contiguously from pin 0 on the same port
// - remapping "mangling" the addresses of the data bytes of the ROM images
//   stored on flash, and the data bytes themselves, to map the hardware pin
//   layout
// - preloading as much as possible into registers before the main work loop,
//   so subsequent operations within the loop take as few instructions as
//   possible
//
// See the various technical documents in [/docs](/docs) for more information.

// Defines for assembly routines
//

// CPU registers - we prefer low registers (r0-r7) to high registers as
// instructions using the low registers tend to be 16-bit vs 32-bit, which
// means they are fetched from flash (or RAM) faster.

// This is the default algorith for serve a single ROM image. It:
// - tests the CS line(s) twice as often as the data byte is loaded from RAM
// - loads the data byte to the address lines even when CS is not active (but
//   with the data lines set as inputs).
//
// The targets (from the MOS 2364 data sheet Feburary 1980) are:
// - tCO - set data line as outputs after CS activates - 200ns
// - tDF - set data line as inputs after CS deactivates - 175ns
// - tOH - data lines remain valid after address lines change - 40ns
// - tACC - maximum time from address to data valid - 450ns
//
// tACC and tCO are the most important - together they mean:
// - we have 450ns from the address lines being set to there being valid data
//   on the data lines (and therefore them being outputs)
// - we also have 200ns from CS activating to the data lines being set as
//   outputs and having valid data on them
//
// They are not cumulative - that is, we cannot assume address lines will be
// valid for tACC-tCO = 250ns before CS activates.  However, we can rely on
// both timings - that is that we will get at least 450ns from address lines
// being set AND 200ns from CS activating.
//
// Together these timings mean we have around twice as long to get the data
// lines loaded with the byte indicated by the address lines as we do to get
// the data lines set as outputs (450ns vs 200ns).  Hence we need to be
// checking the cs line around twice as often as we are checking the address
// lines.  This is reflected in the code below.
//
// They also mean we have to keep checking the address lines and updating the
// data lines while chip select is active. 
//
// We also have to get the data lines back to inputs quickly enough after CS
// deactivates - this is tDF, which is 175ns.  This is actually slightly
// tighter than tCO, but the processing between both CS inactive and active
// cases are very similar we are looking at a worse case of around 150ns with
// the code below on a 100MHz STM32F411.
//
// Finally, we have to make sure we don't change the data lines until at least
// tOH (40ns) after the address lines change.  This should be fine, because
// loading the byte from RAM and applying it to the data lines should always
// take longer than this but it's possible a faster STM32F4 could break it, in
// which case we'd need to add an instruction to two.
//
// Args:
// - TEST_CS_OPTION: The test to use to check if CS has gone active again.
//   - TEST_CS          - Used for serving a single ROM, where the CS line is
//                        active high.
//   - TEST_CS_ACT_LOW  - Used for serving a single ROM, where the CS line is
//                        active low.  This is 1 cycle faster than TEST_CS.

// This algorithm doesn't read the address lines until CS has gone active.
// This appears to be more performant on some machines (C64 character ROM),
// and less performant on others (VIC-20 kernal/BASIC ROMs).  Performant means
// the host runs stably with the STM32F4 clocked at a slower speed.
//
// A variant of this algorithm is used as ALG3, which is used to test whether
// _any_ CS line has gone active, when serving multi-ROM sets.  In that case,
// the code cannot know what address to lookup until the appropriate line has
// gone active.
//
// Args:
// - TEST_CS_OPTION: The test to use to check if CS has gone active again.
//   - TEST_CS          - Used for serving a single ROM, where the CS line is
//                        active high.
//   - TEST_CS_ACT_LOW  - Used for serving a single ROM, where the CS line is
//                        active low.  This is 1 cycle faster than TEST_CS.
//   - TEST_CS_ANY      - Used for serving a multi-ROM set, where CS lines can
//                        be active in any position.
//   - TEST_CS_ANY_ACT_LOW  - Used for serving a multi-ROM set, where CS lines
//                            are active low.  Saves 1 cycle over TEST_CS_ANY.

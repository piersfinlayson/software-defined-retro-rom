# sdrr-fw-parser

Crate to handle parsing an SDRR firmware image.  Can be a .bin or .elf file - or could be the contents of an STM32's flash.

See `cargo docs` for more information, and see [`rust/sdrr-info`](/rust/sdrr-info/README.md) for a tool that uses this crate to extract information from the firmware.
